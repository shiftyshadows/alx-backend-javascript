# TypeScript Learning Project

This project is designed to help you master TypeScript fundamentals and advanced concepts through hands-on learning.

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you will be able to explain the following concepts without relying on Google:

### 1. Basic Types in TypeScript
- Primitive types: `string`, `number`, `boolean`
- Arrays and Tuples
- Enums
- Any, Unknown, Void, Null, and Undefined
- Type assertions and type inference

### 2. Interfaces, Classes, and Functions
- Creating and implementing interfaces
- Class inheritance and modifiers (public, private, protected)
- Abstract classes
- Function types and overloads
- Optional and default parameters

### 3. Working with the DOM and TypeScript
- Type-safe DOM manipulation
- Event handling with TypeScript
- Type assertions for DOM elements
- Working with HTML elements and their properties

### 4. Generic Types
- Generic functions and classes
- Generic constraints
- Using multiple generic types
- Generic interfaces

### 5. Namespaces
- Organizing code with namespaces
- Namespace nesting
- Importing namespaces
- When to use namespaces vs modules

### 6. Declaration Merging
- Interface merging
- Namespace merging
- Merging interfaces with classes
- Understanding declaration merging rules

### 7. Ambient Namespaces
- Importing external libraries without types
- Creating declaration files (.d.ts)
- Ambient namespace declarations
- Working with third-party JavaScript libraries

### 8. Nominal Typing
- Understanding structural vs nominal typing
- Implementing nominal typing patterns
